I have tried keeping lists of finished books over the years on scraps of paper or in old planners but I end up losing them somewhere, somehow, in some other dimension. It often happens that I come across a book recommendation and not even realize that I have already read it, so really, this is more for me to stay organized than for your enjoyment.
