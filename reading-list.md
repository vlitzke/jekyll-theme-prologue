Just about everyone lists reading as one of their hobbies, I am one of them. I tried keeping lists over the years on scraps of paper or in old planners of finished books but I end up losing them somewhere, somehow. It often happens that I come across a book recommmendation and not even realize that I already read it, so I figure this is more for me to stay organized than for your enjoyment.
