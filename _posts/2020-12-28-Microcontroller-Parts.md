ADXL345 Digital Accelerometer
How it Works:
MEMS - Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems
The sensor consists of a micro-machined structure on a silicon wafer. The structure is suspended by polysilicon springs which allow it to deflect smoothly in any direction when subject to acceleration in the X, Y and/or Z axis. Deflection causes a change in capacitance between fixed plates and plates attached to the suspended structure. This change in capacitance on each axis is converted to an output voltage proportional to the acceleration on that axis.

I2C Wiring:
The ADXL345 Breakout has an I2C address of 0x53. It can share the I2C bus with other I2C devices as long as each device has a unique address. Only 4 connections are required for I2C communication:
GND->GND
VIN->+5v
SDA->SDA (Analog 4 on "Classic Arduinos")
SCL->SCL (Analog 5 on "Classic Arduinos")

I2C is a serial protocol for two-wire interface to connect low-speed devices like microcontrollers, EEPROMs, A/D and D/A converters, I/O interfaces and other similar peripherals in embedded systems (https://i2c.info/)
