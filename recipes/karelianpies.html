Karelian Pies (Salla) 

16 pieces
Ingredients
Filling
3 dl water
2 dl porridge rice
6 dl milk
¾ tsp. salt

Cover
1 dl of cold water
½ tea spoons of salt
1 ½ dl of rye flour
1 dl of wheat flour
1 Tbsp. of oil or melted butter

Moistening
¾ dl of milk
25 grams of butter



Preparation
Mix the porridge rice with water and boil for around 10 minutes. Add milk, and mix until the porridge starts to boil. Poach under a cover with low heat until the porridge is ready, mix every now and then. Spice with salt, and let the porridge cool down.
Mix salt, flours and butter into cold water. Mix the dough by hand until it feels smooth and mixed.
Divide dough into 16 pieces. Roll pieces into small balls, flatten them, and cover with plastic. Flatten the dough further by using a rolling pin: use some flour to help in this. The diameter of the cover should be around 17 cm. Sprinkle some rye flour on the covers, pile them up, and cover with plastic.
Prepare pies one by one. Take off the flours on the cover, and put some filling on it. Raise the sides in the middle and ”wrinkle” them.
Put pies into oven in 250-275 °C in the middle for 15-20 minutes.
Dip the pies in a hot milk-butter mix and put them into a bowl . Cover by baking paper and a towel.
Serve with egg butter.
