<p style="text-align: justify;">My best friend Brianna (she knows it!) just recently sent me this fun project about <a href="https://pudding.cool/2020/12/judge-my-spotify/">having an AI judge your awful taste in music</a>, which of course put a dent in what I like to claim as, the best taste in music ever. Take a look at it though, at least I found it hilarious. Anyway, music is a large part of my life and I would love to share it with you, so here are a few songs I listen to a lot and... shape who I am. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"> If you are into exploring different genres, <a href="http://everynoise.com/">this tool</a> is interactive, and there are <a href="music-map.com">music maps</a> and <a href="https://www.gnoosic.com/">other AI systems</a> that provide suggestions based on artists you enjoy listening to. </p>
