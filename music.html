<p style="text-align: justify;">My best friend Brianna (she knows it!) just recently sent me this fun project about <a href="https://pudding.cool/2020/12/judge-my-spotify/">having an AI judge your awful taste in music</a>, which of course put a dent in what I like to claim, the best taste in music ever. Take a look at it though, at least I found it hilarious. Anyway, music is a large part of my life and I would love to share it with you, so here are a few songs I listen to a lot and... shape who I am. </p>
