<p> I am currently a PhD student in the field of Quantitative Evolutionary Genetics at the University of St. Andrews. I am working on the St. Kilda Soay Sheep Project, which is generally hosted by the University of Edinburgh. Ultimately, I would like to attach dataloggers containing accelerometer and GPS data to characterize activity budgets, with the hopes of exploring evolutionary trade-offs in life history traits! </p>
