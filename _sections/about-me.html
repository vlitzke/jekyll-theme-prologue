<p> Well hello there! Welcome to my website. I am either extremely flattered or frightened that you stumbled upon my page. I am currently a PhD student in the field of Quantitative Evolutionary Genetics at the University of St. Andrews. I am working on the St. Kilda Soay Sheep Project, which is generally hosted by the University of Edinburgh. Ultimately, I would like to attach dataloggers containing accelerometer and GPS data to characterize activity budgets, with the hopes of exploring evolutionary trade-offs in life history traits! </p>

<p> Due to the current pandemic, I was unable to get my hands on these dataloggers (they ideally should have been tested last year in April, in Wales on a farm population of Soay sheep). Soooo... what better thing to do than try to make some ourselves! If you take a look at my blog, you can read up more about my journey. Fair warning though, it is pretty nerdy and technical. ;) </p>
