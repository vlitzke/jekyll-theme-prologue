<p> Well hello there! Welcome to my website. I am either extremely flattered or frightened that you stumbled upon my page. I am currently a PhD student in the field of Quantitative Evolutionary Genetics at the University of St. Andrews. I am working on the St. Kilda Soay Sheep Project, which is generally hosted by the University of Edinburgh. Ultimately, I would like to attach dataloggers containing accelerometer and GPS data to characterize activity budgets, with the hopes of exploring evolutionary trade-offs in life history traits! </p>

<p> Due to the current pandemic, I was unable to get my hands on these dataloggers (they ideally should have been tested last year in April, in Wales on a farm population of Soay sheep). Soooo... what better thing to do than try to make some ourselves! If you take a look at my blog, you can read up more about my journey. </p>
  
<p> EMPSEB 27 Abstract: Quantifying how organisms move in time and space is essential to our understanding of how they interact with each other and their environments, and how they allocate their limited budgets of time and energy to maximise their fitness. However, there are several challenges in acquiring and analysing such data, especially on a population scale. First, visual observations are inefficient, while off-the-shelf automated dataloggers can be expensive to deploy on a large number of animals. Second, behavioural classification algorithms are invariably fitted to specific training data sets for each study system; it may be difficult to obtain data de novo for tuning algorithms in any given system. To address these issues, we are developing low-cost, open source dataloggers to collect data on both the movement - acceleration in three directions (surge, sway and heave) â€“ and location of domestic Shetland and wild St. Kilda Soay sheep (Ovis aries). We used video recordings to ground-truth our accelerometer data, then investigated the application of random forest trees to classify behaviours such as eating, walking, grazing and lying. We report on the development and interchangeability of these models to recover ethograms (behaviour budgets). This gives us an improved resolution of the trade-offs individuals face when allocating their time and energy, across both different behaviours and different habitats.  </p>
