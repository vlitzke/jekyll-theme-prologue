<p style="text-align: justify;">I am extremely (hyper-)active and like to stay active! It mentally sooths me and unfortunately can also be a mode of procrastination. I am generally into running, cycling, going to the gym (need that instant gratification high), hiking (already hiked my first four munros!) and soccer (*sorry* football). Other sports come and go in phases, such as squash, badminton, skiing, ultimate frisbee and most recently climbing, because everyone in the biology department climbs and I want to fit in haha. So if you are interested in what I do, here ya go. Also please do not hesitate to reach out if you want to do sports with me, the more the merrier. </p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">Only runs because I cannot figure out how to add all my activities here?! </p>
